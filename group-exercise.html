        <strong>1-  What is a font stack and how should the best one be chosen?</strong>
      <p>Answer: A font stack is a list of fonts in the CSS font-family, all separated by commas. Fonts are listed in order of preference that you would like them to appear in case of a problem, such as a font not working in the selected browser.

      <p>Example for Times New Roman:</p>
      <h1 class="first-h1-q1">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> font-family: Cambria, "Hoefler Text", Utopia, "Liberation Serif", "Nimbus Roman No9 L Regular", Times, "Times New Roman", serif;
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Example for Times Impact:</p>
      <h1 class="second-h1-q1">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, "Franklin Gothic Bold", Charcoal, "Helvetica Inserat", "Bitstream Vera Sans Bold", "Arial Black", sans-serif;

        <strong>2-  What is the difference between serif and sans serif font?</strong>>
      </p>
      <p>So, in a nutshell, serif fonts have those decorative lines or tapers (also commonly referred to as 'tails' or 'feet') while sans serif fonts don't.

        <strong>3-  How can a developer use a Google font?</strong>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        You can choose one of 2 methods to use a google/web font.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      <strong>Option 1</strong>
        Online font services generally store and serve fonts for you so you don't have to worry about writing the @font-face code. Instead, you generally just need to insert a simple line or two of code into your site to make everything work. Examples include Adobe Fonts and Cloud.typography. Most of these services are subscription-based, with the notable exception of Google Fonts, a useful free service, especially for rapid testing work and writing demos.
        On the html page in the header link to the font with a link elelment above the css stylesheet. (So it will load into the CSS stylesheet)

<!--        < link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comforter&family=Open+Sans:wght@300&family=Quintessential&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">-->
          </p>
          After this you can call the desired font in the CSS style sheet.
          <p>
            <strong>h1{<br>
              font: Tangerine;<br>
            }</strong>
          </p>
      <strong>Option 2</strong>
        To store the font locally you can download a .zip file of your desired font. Store this zip file in the same directory as your css/html files. On your stylesheet.css at the very top of the page you will need to insert "@font-face rule sets"
          <p>
            <strong>@font-face { <br>
            font-family: "zantrokeregular";<br>
<!--            src: url("fonts/zantroke-webfont.woff2") format("woff2"), url("fonts/zantroke-webfont.woff")-->
            format("woff");<br>
            font-weight: normal;<br>
             font-style: normal;<br>
             }</strong><br>
<!--            font-family: "zantrokeregular", serif;-->
          </p>
              <h1 class="first-h1-q3">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1>
              <h1 class="second-h1-q3">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1><br>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <strong>4-  How can a developer figure out what font is being used on a given web page?</strong>
        <p id="answer4"> Answer4.  Open the console. Use the Elements tab. Select the text (body) in the console. Click on the Computed tab in the lower portion of the console and search for "font-family." To see the CSS related to the font, look under the Styles tab. You can scroll through to search for font-related values. However, as there might be overrides and irrelevant style rules here, the Computed tab is usually more helpful.
        </p>

      <strong>5-  Prepare code examples to present answers to the following questions:</strong><br>
      </p>
      <br>
        <h1 class="first-h1-q5">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1>

      <strong>6-  What is a websafe font?</strong>
        <p>Websafe fonts are fonts that are included with most operating systems. Some examples of Web safe serif fonts include Georgia and Times New Roman.
          In CSS this would look like
        </p>
        <h1 class="first-h1-q6">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1>
        <h1 class="second-h1-q6">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1><br>

     <p><strong> 7- What is the difference between using pixels, ems, and rems?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>.main-header  {
        font-size: 14px;
        }
        </strong></p>
        <p>
        "Pixels are a unit of measurement that are based on set sizing. They are the unit for measuring dimensions on a screen and are used when precise design is required".
        </p>
      <p><strong>
        .three { <br>
        font-size: 2em; <br>
        }<br>
      </strong></p>

        "In most cases, unless browser default is set to something else, an em is 16 px".
          <br>

      <p><strong>
          .one { <br>
        font-size: 1.2rem; <br>
        } <br></strong>
        "by default each rem will equal 16px, unless there is a pre-determined root".
      </p>
        <h1 class="first-h1-q7">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1>
        <h1 class="second-h1-q7">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1>

      <strong>8- How can the space between letters in CSS be controlled?</strong>
        <p>The space inbetween letters in CSS can be controlled by using the <br>"letter-spacing" attribute. Below are some examples.
        </p>
        <h1 class="first-h1-q8">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1>
        <h1 class="second-h1-q8">Text and Font Properties 1 (Group 3)</h1>
