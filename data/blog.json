    "content": "he flier should feel like a warm handshake can we have another option. I really like the colour but can you change it is this the best we can do, and can you use a high definition screenshot do less with more, but can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front, or i think this should be fairly easy so if you just want to have a look, i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand. I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost we try your eye, but can you change everything? can't you just take a picture from the internet? i love it, but can you invert all colors? this was not according to brief, and I need a website. How much will it cost. This looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost, I think we need to start from scratch, or i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand, for give us a complimentary logo along with the website, for i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version can you make it stand out more?. Use a kpop logo that's not a kpop logo! ugh it needs to be the same, but totally different can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious, nor it's great, can you add a beard though , and can you make the blue bluer?, so that's going to be a chunk of change is this the best we can do. Doing some work for us \"pro bono\" will really add to your portfolio i promise is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy, but you are lucky to even be doing this for us could you do an actual logo instead of a font. Can you punch up the fun level on these icons can you make it look more designed , and can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front, but can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch. Can you put \"find us on facebook\" by the facebook logo? could you move it a tad to the left, but I really think this could go viral, and will royalties in the company do instead of cash, for we have big contacts we will promote you.",
